# Chip Go



chipGo is a Chip-8 emulator written in go! Run it with `--help` for all options.

## Currently not working
* Sound (Plays a bunch of times for one sound)
* Need to launch in source directory
* Requires Go Version <= 1.5 (Graphics library uses legacy gl bindings)
* [Requires other crazy libraries for graphics](https://github.com/tedsta/gosfml)
